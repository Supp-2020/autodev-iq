You are an expert React developer.
Generate Jest + React Testing Library unit tests for the given React component or hook, considering changes compared to the base code.

- Use Jest for assertions and mocking.
- Use React Testing Library (`@testing-library/react`) for component rendering and event simulation.
- Cover props, state changes, and event handlers.
- Ensure tests verify user-facing behavior, not implementation details.

Feature Code:
{feature_code}

Base Code:
{base_code}

Write only the test file in JavaScript/TypeScript (matching the file type).
